# Migration Implications: Feature Branch Model Changes

## Critical Warning: Database State Divergence

### Database Synchronization Issues
When developing model changes on a feature branch, a critical issue arises with database state synchronization:

1. The database can only exist in one state at a time
2. Migrations applied on a feature branch will modify the database schema
3. Switching branches (e.g., back to main) becomes problematic because:
   - The database schema no longer matches the main branch's expected state
   - Main branch code may fail due to missing or modified fields
   - Migration history becomes inconsistent between branches

### Recommended Approaches

#### 1. Development Environment Strategy
- Use separate databases for different branches
  ```bash
  # Example: Create branch-specific database settings
  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'NAME': f"{BASE_DB_NAME}_{BRANCH_NAME}",
          # other settings...
      }
  }
  ```
- Or use database templates/snapshots
  - Take snapshot of clean main database
  - Create new database from snapshot when switching branches

#### 2. Migration Development Strategy
- Keep feature branch migrations isolated
  - Create migrations in a separate numbered sequence
  - Example: if main has 0001_initial.py, use 0001_feature_initial.py
- Avoid modifying existing migrations from main
- Plan to squash migrations before merging to main

#### 3. Branch Switching Protocol
Before switching branches:
1. Backup current database state
2. Reset database to clean state
3. Apply migrations from target branch
```bash
# Example workflow
pg_dump dbname > backup.sql  # Backup current state
dropdb dbname                # Reset database
createdb dbname              # Create fresh database
git checkout target-branch   # Switch branches
python manage.py migrate     # Apply target branch migrations
```

#### 4. Merge Strategy
When ready to merge to main:
1. Squash feature branch migrations
2. Rebase on latest main
3. Test migration sequence
4. Document upgrade path

## Key Considerations

### 1. Database Schema Dependencies

#### Foreign Key Relationships
- PeriodContent â†’ PeriodTemplate foreign key relationship must be preserved
- Changes to PeriodTemplate's UUID primary key would affect PeriodContent references
- Any new required fields need appropriate default values or migration strategy

#### Historical Records
- PeriodTemplate uses django-simple-history
- Model changes need corresponding historical model updates
- Field additions/removals affect both main and historical tables

#### Indexing Strategy
- Complex indexing on date, period_number, and version fields
- Index modifications need careful ordering in migrations
- Consider performance impact during migration execution

### 2. Data Integrity

#### Default Template Mechanism
- get_default_template() function used as default for foreign key
- Changes to default template logic need careful migration planning
- Consider existing records relying on default template

#### Version Control System
- PeriodTemplate implements version tracking
- Changes must preserve version integrity
- Consider impact on unique_together constraints (name, version)

#### Soft Deletion
- Both models implement soft deletion
- Changes must preserve deletion status
- Consider impact on queries and filters

### 3. Migration Strategy Recommendations

#### Pre-Migration Tasks
1. Backup database before applying feature branch changes
2. Document current state of all affected models
3. Create data migration test plan

#### Migration Execution Order
1. Add new fields as nullable or with defaults
2. Update indexes and constraints
3. Migrate existing data
4. Add any new validation rules
5. Remove deprecated fields

#### Post-Migration Verification
1. Verify historical record integrity
2. Check default template functionality
3. Validate version control system
4. Test soft deletion behavior
5. Verify index performance

### 4. Potential Risks

#### Data Loss Risks
- Template version history corruption
- Default template reference issues
- Historical record inconsistencies

#### Performance Risks
- Long-running migrations on large datasets
- Index rebuilding impact
- Cache invalidation overhead

#### Application Risks
- Signal handler compatibility
- Cache key format changes
- API backward compatibility

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

#### Development Phase
1. Create comprehensive test cases
2. Use Django's test database for migration testing
3. Implement rollback procedures
4. Document all schema changes

#### Deployment Phase
1. Schedule maintenance window
2. Prepare rollback scripts
3. Monitor system performance
4. Validate data integrity

#### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor application performance
2. Verify data consistency
3. Check historical record accuracy
4. Validate caching behavior

### 6. Branch Management

#### Feature Branch
1. Keep migrations isolated
2. Avoid migration conflicts
3. Regular rebasing with main
4. Comprehensive testing

#### Main Branch
1. Clear migration dependencies
2. Backward compatible changes
3. Proper documentation
4. Version control consideration

## Conclusion

Model changes in the feature branch require careful consideration of:
- Database state synchronization between branches
- Complex relationships between PeriodTemplate and PeriodContent
- Historical record maintenance
- Version control system
- Default template mechanism
- Soft deletion functionality
- Cache invalidation
- Index performance

Following these guidelines will help ensure successful integration of feature branch changes while maintaining data integrity and application performance.
