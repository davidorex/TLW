1. State Management
```
!ctx {scope}   - Direct GPT focus
!save {key}    - Preserve important state
!load {key}    - Restore needed context
!clear         - Reset when needed
```

2. Progress Control
- Use !save to checkpoint progress
- Use !load to resume work
- Use !clear for fresh starts
- Use !ctx to maintain focus

## Directory Usage

1. Active Development
- /specs/current/ for ongoing work
- /specs/development/vectors/ for progress
- /specs/knowledge/ for patterns
- /specs/vision/ for direction

2. State Tracking
- Keep current_state.json updated
- Archive completed states
- Maintain clear timeline
- Track progress vectors

## Management Tips

- Break complex tasks into steps
- Let GPT verify each step
- Maintain clear focus areas
- Track progress explicitly

2. Context Control
- Keep contexts focused
- Update states incrementally
- Archive completed work
- Maintain clean structure

3. Progress Management
- Monitor development vectors
- Update vision as needed
- Track optimizations
- Maintain documentation

## Best Practices

1. Task Assignment
- Clear objectives
- Defined scope
- Step-by-step progress
- Regular verification

2. State Management
- Regular updates
