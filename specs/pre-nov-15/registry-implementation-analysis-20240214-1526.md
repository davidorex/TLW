# ContentRegistry Implementation Analysis

## Date: 2024-02-14, 15:26

### Specification Compliance

#### Existing Implementation
```python
class ContentRegistry:
    _registry = {}

    @classmethod
    def register(cls, model_class, **options):
        """Register a model for period scheduling"""
        cls._registry[model_class] = options
        return model_class  # Allow use as a decorator

    @classmethod
    def get_content_types(cls):
        """Return all registered content types"""
        return list(cls._registry.keys())

    @classmethod
    def get_registered_models(cls):
        """Return dictionary of registered models and their options"""
        return cls._registry.copy()
```

### Comparative Analysis

1. Core Functionality
   - Fully compliant with specification requirements
   - Maintains core method signatures and behaviors
   - Provides content type registration and retrieval

2. Enhanced Features
   - Decorator support via `return model_class`
   - List-based content type retrieval
   - Additional method for retrieving registered models with options

### Reasoning for Retention

#### Compliance
- Meets all specification requirements
- Does not deviate from core design principles

#### Additional Value
- Decorator support increases usability
- `get_registered_models()` provides flexibility for future extensions
- Minimal overhead with additional functionality

### Conclusion
Retain the existing implementation. The additional methods provide value without compromising the specification's core intent.

### Recommendation
No modifications required to core/registry.py.
