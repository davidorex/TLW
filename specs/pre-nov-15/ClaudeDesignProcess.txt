# Claude Design Process Instructions By fixguzman

## 1. Project Initialization

- Begin by creating a dedicated project folder for the development process. This folder will house all development files in `.md` format.
- Use a tool like Obsidian to keep track of notes, instructions, and modular components of the project.

## 2. Design Modular Project Structure

- Define the structure of your project by identifying core modules and their relationships. This will serve as the foundation for all development work.
- Follow a clean architecture approach, focusing on a modular design that separates features and reduces dependencies.

## 3. Task-Based System Prompts

- For each new task, set a unique system prompt. Avoid using the same prompt across different tasks, as each should be specific to the requirements of the task at hand.
- Adjust the system prompt based on the context of the feature being developed to maximize the relevance and efficiency of the AI’s responses.

## 4. Feature-by-Feature Documentation

- Document each feature individually, noting specific instructions for development and any requirements or dependencies.
- Maintain a modular documentation approach so that each feature can be referenced independently and worked on without affecting other modules.

## 5. Context Management and Avoiding Duplicates

- To reduce the risk of hallucinations or file duplication, reference existing documents or modules as necessary.
- Keep related documents linked or cross-referenced within the project folder to ensure continuity and maintain clear context across tasks.

## 6. Iterative Development

- Approach development iteratively, working on one module or feature at a time.
- Use the project structure as a basis for this incremental process, ensuring each module is complete and well-documented before moving on to the next.
