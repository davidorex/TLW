# Guide: Turning Natural Language Specs into Vectorized Prompts

## Overview
This guide will take you through the steps to convert a natural language specification into a structured, token-efficient, vectorized prompt for guiding code generation.

### Step 1: Segment the Specification
Break the specification into sections like "Overview", "Requirements", "Methods", etc. Organizing the spec file makes it easier to extract meaningful embeddings for each part.

### Step 2: Summarize Key Sections
For each section, write a concise summary that captures the core requirements or functionalities described. Summaries help condense information to reduce token usage.

### Step 3: Generate Embeddings
Using a code-aware embedding model, convert each summarized section into a vector representation. These embeddings help capture semantic meaning and structure for later prompt creation.

### Step 4: Organize the Vectorized Data
Store the vectorized summaries and embeddings in a structured JSON format. This organized data will allow you to reference specific parts in prompts as needed.

### Step 5: Construct Concise Prompts
With the summarized sections and embeddings ready, create efficient prompts that include only necessary summaries or embeddings for the task at hand.

This process will help you generate accurate, context-aware prompts with minimal token usage.
