# Mixins Design Recommendation

## Date: 2024-02-14, 14:23

### Context
Review of project structure and Django/Python best practices for implementing mixins in the project.

### Model Mixins Analysis
- Existing implementations in `core/models/abstracts.py` are robust and comprehensive
- Current abstract classes (`BaseModel`, `AuditableModel`, `HistoricalModel`) effectively encapsulate timestamp and user tracking functionality
- Creating a separate `mixins.py` would introduce unnecessary redundancy
- Best practice is to maintain related model abstractions together in a single file

### View Mixins Analysis
- Class-based views benefit from modular, reusable mixins
- Separate `core/views/mixins.py` aligns with Django design patterns
- Promotes separation of concerns
- Allows cross-cutting view-related functionality to be easily imported and composed

### Recommendation
1. Retain existing model abstractions in `core/models/abstracts.py`
2. Create `core/views/mixins.py` with:
   - PermissionRequiredMixin
   - AuditableMixin

### Rationale
- Maintains code clarity
- Follows Django and Python best practices
- Supports future extensibility
- Minimizes code duplication

### Next Steps
- Implement view mixins in `core/views/mixins.py`
- Ensure mixins follow the specification in the project foundation document
