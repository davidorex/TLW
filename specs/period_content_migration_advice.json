            "details": "Instead of hardcoding model references, use Django's dynamic model reference feature. For example, use 'app_label.ModelName' in the ForeignKey or ManyToManyField definitions. This allows Django to resolve the model at runtime, even if it's in another app."

            "details": "Create temporary placeholder models for 'Homeroom' and 'YearGroup' within the current app. These models can be minimal and only include the necessary fields to satisfy the migrations. Once the actual models are available in the other app, update the references."

            "strategy": "Use conditional imports",
            "details": "Use try-except blocks to conditionally import the models from the other app. This allows the code to run without errors during development, while still allowing for proper model resolution when the other app is available."

            "details": "As a last resort, comment out the ManyToManyField relationships in the 'PeriodContent' model temporarily. Run 'makemigrations' to create the initial migrations without errors. Once the other app is integrated, uncomment the relationships and update the migrations."
