# Calendar Model Implementation Requirements

## AcademicYear
Required Functionality:
1. Date Range Management
   - Validate start/end dates fall on appropriate boundaries (typically Aug-Jun)
   - Enforce no overlap with other academic years
   - Handle leap years correctly

2. Structure Type
   - SEMESTER: Two terms, each with two quarters
   - TRIMESTER: Three terms
   - Structure affects term generation and week numbering

3. Term Generation
   - Auto-generate terms on save
   - Calculate proper term boundaries based on structure
   - Maintain term sequence integrity
   - Handle holidays and breaks

4. Key Methods:
```python
def get_term_boundaries(self) -> list[date]:
    """Return list of term start/end dates based on structure"""

def is_valid_school_date(self, date) -> bool:
    """Check if date falls within year and isn't holiday"""

def get_active_term(self, date) -> Term:
    """Return term containing date"""

def generate_terms(self) -> None:
    """Create term records based on structure"""
```

## Term
Required Functionality:
1. Date Range Integrity
   - Must fall within academic year
   - No gaps between terms
   - No overlaps between terms

2. Quarter Management (Semesters only)
   - Auto-generate two quarters per semester
   - Quarter boundaries at midpoint
   - Track quarter sequence

3. Position Calculations
   - Week numbering from term start
   - Term progress tracking
   - Quarter position tracking

4. Key Methods:
```python
def get_week_number(self, date) -> int:
    """Calculate week number (1-based) for date within term"""

def get_quarter_dates(self) -> Optional[list[date]]:
    """Return quarter boundaries if semester"""

def get_progress(self, date) -> float:
    """Return term completion percentage"""
```

## SchedulePattern
Required Functionality:
1. Period Definition
   - Morning block with n periods
   - Lunch period(s)
   - Afternoon block with n periods
   - Optional evening block
   - Passing time between periods

2. Schedule Rules
   - Default vs override patterns
   - Recurring patterns (e.g., every Monday)
   - Special event patterns
   - Exam day patterns

3. Key Methods:
```python
def generate_periods(self, date) -> list[Period]:
    """Generate actual periods for given date"""

def applies_to_date(self, date) -> bool:
    """Check if pattern should apply to date"""

def get_period_times(self) -> dict:
    """Return period start/end times"""
```

## SchoolDay
Required Functionality:
1. Date Management
   - Primary lookup by date
   - Fall within academic year
   - Track day type/status

2. Schedule Resolution
   - Apply default pattern
   - Handle overrides
   - Special schedule days

3. Period Generation
   - Calculate actual periods
   - Apply modifications
   - Handle schedule changes

4. Key Methods:
```python
def get_schedule(self) -> SchedulePattern:
    """Resolve effective schedule for day"""

def get_periods(self) -> list[Period]:
    """Generate actual periods for day"""

def is_regular_day(self) -> bool:
    """Check if normal schedule applies"""
```

## Common Requirements
1. Performance
   - Optimize date-based queries
   - Cache calculations where appropriate
   - Minimize database hits

2. Validation
   - Date range integrity
   - Schedule consistency
   - Pattern validity

3. Flexibility
   - Handle schedule exceptions
   - Support different school structures
   - Accommodate special events

4. Integration
   - Support calendar views
   - Enable schedule lookups
   - Facilitate reporting

Would you like me to:
1. Provide the actual model code next
2. Detail the calculation methods
3. Specify the admin interfaces
4. Something else?
